# 🍀 hey, i'm teja. :D

I'm a researcher at **IIIT Hyderabad**. Building things that (hopefully) scale.

### current focus
- 🧷 researching at iiit-h
- 🌑 writing python + c++
- 📟 lost in the terminal

### find me
Since my website is a bit of a ghost town right now, the best way to reach me is via email.

- **Email:** [teja.pudi@research.iiit.ac.in](mailto:teja.pudi@research.iiit.ac.in)
- **GitHub:** [@tejavvo](https://github.com/tejavvo)
- **Web:** [researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~teja.pudi/](https://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~teja.pudi/)
